# About Winkalc

The calculator is part of my personal program for educational purpose, in which I try to simulate a production workflow touching on both front-end and back-end development. This project includes a Rust CLI for some basic algorithm in number theory, a document site based upon the markdown-to-html framework Vitepress, as well as exercising elementary Git, shell script and Vercel for the sake of deployment. Although the code is no big deal, if not juvenile, I do hope you can learn something if you are a newcomer to these tech-stacks.

During my college Algebra courses I was assigned homework involving recursive Euclidean division, only to find it dull and prone to error. The algorithm is ingeniously elegant and efficient, but does not suit human brains. As my interest and career outlook shift to computers, I chose my first serious program to be a light-weight arithmetic calculator.
