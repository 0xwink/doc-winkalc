# Acknowledgement

I would like to thank the authors of all dependencies and toolchains, especially: Mise-en-Place, Vitepress, Regex, Render. Had it not been your kindly open-source projects, it would be impossible to build such a beautiful documentation, to write the core logic of polynomial parser, and to share my efforts online for free. I also thank Google and ChatGPT for information gleaning. Finally, of course, huge thanks to the devs of Rust, my favorite language.

I was totally new to programming before this project â€” I still am. However, the generosity and abundance of the open-source community is overwhelming. It's an immense fortune not only for seasoned devs, but also (vitally!) for those enthusiasts who know nothing except a desire to dive damn hard and build magic from scratch. I've never seen another industry with open vibes comparable to coders. That's why I aspire to be one of them.
