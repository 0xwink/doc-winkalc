::: tip Remark
`>` appears automatically at the start of each round of dialogue. Don't type it manually. 

Brackets (`[]` and `{}`) are necessary in order to ensure parser works properly. Because we allow whitespaces present inside a formula of `:OPERANT`, the parser cannot tell where to truncate between arguments without brackets' help. 

`:ALG` and `:OP` are not case-sensitive. As to `:OPERANTS`, keep `x` in polynomial and `i` in complex numbers in lowercase, otherwise the parser may throw an error.

::: details Examples
Here we omit the outputs. 
I advise you have a look at the [examples](/example) section, where host much more instances with output attached.

## `:ALG`
Currently, six algebraic structures are supported, divided into two categories, rings and fields. 
See the [parse](/parse) page for a detailed description on how commands take effect mathematically in each case. 

**Fields**:
``` 
Q, F(p)
```
Here, `Q` stands for rationals. `F(p)` is the finite field of `p` elements, in 
which `p` must be specified as a positive prime number. `F(13)`, `F(19)` are accepted, while `F(10)`, `F(0)`, `F(-7)`, and `F()` are not.


**Rings**:

```
Z, Zi, QPol, FPol(p)
```
`Z` stands for integers. `QPol` means polynomials with rational coefficients. `FPol(p)` means 
polynomial with `F(p)` coefficients. 

`Zi` means Gaussian integers, namely all complex numbers `a+bi` such 
that `a` and `b` are integers.

## `:OP`
`:OP` means operations. In some sense, it's the main component of a command. Following are all supported arguments:

```
Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Divmod, Bezout
```

`Add`, `Sub`, `Mul` mean addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) respectively. They are available for any `:ALG`. 

`Div`, division (/), only makes sense if `:ALG` is a field. If the second operand is zero, it returns a error. 

Similarly, `Divmod` and `Bezout` are valid only if `:ALG` is a ring. `Divmod` evaluates the Euclidean division, 
outputing a quotient and a remainder. If the second operand is zero, it errs. `Bezout` returns the triple in BÃ©zout's identity.

## `:OPERANT`

`:OPERANT` means numbers that engage in an operation. 
So far, all operations take exactly two operants. Future features may drop this requirement.

Depending on your choice of `:ALG`, the parser uses different strategies to read it. The rules of formatting operants are specified in 
the [parse](/parse) section.
